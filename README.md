# A Company chatbot for Contoso using Integrated Vectorization and the Azure AI Studio




### Main objectives

Self-Learning journey using data from the Contoso Electronics demo data. This repo will be mainly dedicated to implementing and discovering best practices when it comes to:
- **Azure AI Search**: thoroughly understanding chunking and vectorization of the .pdf files that are used in this demo. I will also try to explore different types of chunking p.e hierarchical chunking
- **Prompt Flow**: Create the best possible system message for my desired flow, and start working with prompty to better test my flow's prompt.
- **Evaluation**: trying to assess how to best conduct evaluation of the data. This makes it mandatory not only the creation of the evaluation data sets, but also will be used the Red Teaming approach using PyRIT.
