# A Company chatbot for Contoso using Integrated Vectorization and the Azure AI Studio

This repository hosts the development of an internal chatbot for Contoso Electronics, designed to assist employees by providing quick and accurate answers to questions about company benefits, internal policies, and job descriptions. The chatbot leverages natural language processing to understand and respond to a wide range of queries, ensuring that employees have access to essential information at their fingertips, enhancing their overall work experience and productivity.

Internal chatbots such as this play a crucial role in modern organizations by streamlining access to information and resources. They reduce the burden on HR and administrative staff by handling repetitive queries, allowing these departments to focus on more strategic tasks. Moreover, chatbots enhance employee satisfaction and efficiency by providing immediate, accurate responses, fostering a more informed and engaged workforce. As a result, internal chatbots contribute significantly to the operational efficiency and overall productivity of a company.

Employees at Contoso will be able to access more information on their company's policies in a faster and efficient way.


## Main objectives

Self-Learning journey using data from the Contoso Electronics demo data. This repo will be mainly dedicated to implementing and discovering best practices when it comes to:
- **Azure AI Search**: thoroughly understanding chunking and vectorization of the .pdf files that are used in this demo. I will also try to explore different types of chunking p.e hierarchical chunking
- **Prompt Flow**: Create the best possible system message for my desired flow, and start working with prompty to better test my flow's prompt.
- **Evaluation**: trying to assess how to best conduct evaluation of the data. This makes it mandatory not only the creation of the evaluation data sets, but also will be used the Red Teaming approach using PyRIT.
